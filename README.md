## Why did I make this tool

- The people who do ping processes many times at the day will adopt this tool; because I'm one of them.

- The gist aim was to make a reachable tool, at any time with the most minimal mouse usage; only `Alt + Q` is enough to launch, theoretically, an endless ping processes.

- And of course, presents the results in nice looking, easy to track table, or a gentle graph that indicates the stability of the responses.

- Bonus feature, control the delay between each request with ease.

## Shortcuts

- `Alt + Q`: Show/Hide the tool.

- `Alt + W`: Focus on the tool if it's shown.

- `Alt + P`: Pause/Resume all the ping processes.

- `Alt + T`: Terminate all the ping processes.

*You can reach this info, and others (like how the auto launch the tool at startup) from the tool's tray icon.*

## Issues

Despite that there is no a free time to develop this tool and fix the issues, I'm very happy for any created issues in this repo, I'll try to keep watching, fixing and updating as much as possible.
